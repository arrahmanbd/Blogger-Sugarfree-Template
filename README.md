## Getting Started

Please see [Documentation](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/docs.html) before importing one of the available [Blog-Themes](blog-theme) for Gelati Sugarfree.

Although optional, you might also consider to import some [Demo-Content](demo-content) to gain better understanding of its internal mechanisms with the provided examples. Feel free to delete/unplublish unnecessary Posts, Pages and Labels afterwards.

> Some of the Posts contain <i>Jump-Breaks</i>, a feature of Blogger/Blogpost represented by the following expression: <pre><i>&lt;!--more--&gt;</i></pre> 
> When exporting content in Blogger/Blogspot these expressions get converted to plain &lt;a&gt;-Tags: <pre><i>&lt;a name='more'&gt;</i> resp. <i>&amp;lt;a name='more'&amp;gt;</i></pre>
> Unfortunately, after importing such content you have to manual replace all occurences of "ill-converted" <i>Jump-Breaks</i> to their correct expression with the help of Post-Editor.

## Final Notes

As stated in [Advanced Setup Guide](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/docs.html#advanced_setup) for most use-cases like

* custom domain usage 
* self-hosting

you should be fine with pre-built [Blog-Resources](blog-resources) provided for <i>Download</i> here on GitHub.

In case you don't want to (or simply don't have the capabilitites to do so) use Gelati Sugarfree's <i>hosted Assets</i>, as referenced in Blog-Themes.

If you have followed [Quick Setup Guide](https://gelati.sugar3.io/p/docs.html#quick_installation) and everything worked well you might already have a working setup of Gelati Sugarfree ðŸŽ‰.
